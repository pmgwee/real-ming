# CEO Office

> **Everything that needs Ming personally lives here.** When agent work stops on a blocker, this folder is where the instructions are. Nowhere else.

Whenever `npm run graph:status` prints `BLOCKED ON YOU`, come here.

## 🚦 Current status

*As of 2026-08-29 · run `npm run graph:status` for live truth*

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Phase 3 tickets closed | **11 of 44** |
| Startable by an agent right now | **RM-10** |
| Waiting on you | **Nothing** |

**RM-09 is complete.** Master Tasks and its six linked Work Views are live and the graph can continue with RM-10's migration rehearsal.

---

## 🔀 Decisions awaiting you

**None open.** Anything needing a yes/no from you appears here with a recommendation — a pull request, a vendor choice, an architecture change. You should never have to discover one yourself.

*Settled:* [PR #46](https://github.com/pmgwee/real-ming/pull/46) merged into `main` on 2026-08-27 with your approval — the 7 closed tickets plus tooling and baseline.

> ⚠️ GitHub shares one number space between issues and pull requests. `#1` is the spec, `#2`–`#45` are the 44 tickets, and `#46` was the first **pull request** — it continues the same counter. A number alone does not tell you which kind it is.

## ✅ What needs you

**Nothing right now.** The completed [RM-09 provisioning runbook](RM-09-master-tasks-provisioning-runbook.md) records the Notion setup and live outcome.

Both initial gates remain closed:

| Gate | Closed | Outcome |
| --- | --- | --- |
| RM-06 · identities and secrets · [#7](https://github.com/pmgwee/real-ming/issues/7) | ✅ 28 Aug 2026 | 9/9 provisioned, TC-01 to TC-05 all pass. Control plane runs locally; always-on host deferred to RM-15. |
| RM-24 · DuitSini pilot update · [#25](https://github.com/pmgwee/real-ming/issues/25) | ✅ 28 Aug 2026 | Add OpenCode and CommandCode provider presets. Code change plus a Supabase migration, so two separate Approvals. |

One further working session will come back to you mid-flight, by design:

- **RM-11** needs a CEO-accepted status for every active item across your five legacy Notion task databases, plus Approval of the cutover plan before anything is mutated. That is a working session, not a rubber stamp.

The runbooks stay as the record of what was done: [Gate 1](GATE-1-provisioning-runbook.md) · [Gate 2](GATE-2-pilot-selection-runbook.md).

## ▶️ How to restart agent work

1. Run `npm run graph:status` and confirm it names a ticket rather than `BLOCKED ON YOU`.
2. Open [RESUME-PROMPT.md](RESUME-PROMPT.md) and copy the block that matches your agent.

Nothing needs restarting or re-explaining. The scheduler reconciles against live GitHub, so a closed issue is all it takes.

> 💡 **Using Codex or another agent?** `/goal` is a Claude Code slash command that installs a stop condition; other agents read it as plain text and are likely to stop after one ticket. `RESUME-PROMPT.md` carries a portable version for exactly that case. The conventions themselves live in `AGENTS.md`, which agents read by convention, so they do not depend on which tool you use.

## 📍 What happens after Gate 1

Closing RM-06 alone releases 31 tickets. The first seven are a **narrow sequential chain** — this is Tracer 1, the Daily Operations Loop:

```
RM-07, RM-09  →  RM-10, RM-12  →  RM-11 ⚠️  →  RM-13  →  RM-14  →  RM-15  →  RM-16 🎉
Telegram +       migration        needs YOU     07:30     evening   always-on  TRACER
Master Tasks     rehearsal        again         brief     roll-up   env        PROVEN
```

After RM-16 the graph fans out hard — 4, then 5, then 9 tickets per wave. **RM-16 is the milestone worth aiming for.**

⚠️ **RM-11 will need you mid-flight.** It requires a CEO-accepted status for every active item across your five real Notion task databases, plus Approval of the cutover plan *before* anything is mutated. That is a working session, not a rubber stamp.

## 🌿 Branching plan — one PR per milestone

One long-lived branch would grow into a 44-ticket, 100-plus-file pull request nobody can meaningfully review, defeating the review discipline this system exists to enforce. So each milestone gets its own branch and its own PR.

| # | Branch | Contents | Review checkpoint | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `docs/final-architecture-v1` | RM-01…RM-05, RM-08, RM-41 + tooling | foundation | ✅ **merged** |
| 2 | `feat/tracer-1-daily-operations` | RM-07 … RM-16 | Tracer 1 proven | ⬅️ **next** |
| 3 | `feat/context-and-portfolio` | RM-17 … RM-23, RM-42 | Context Vault + portfolio live | waiting |
| 4 | `feat/microsaas-loop` | RM-25 … RM-28, RM-34 | DuitSini promotion proven | waiting |
| 5 | `feat/domain-loops` | remainder → RM-40 | Full v1.1 readiness | waiting |

Each merge is a point where you review an increment you can actually hold in your head — the same principle as reviewing an Outcome Report instead of raw agent activity.

`main` now holds the merged foundation. Milestone 2 branches from it.

> 💡 **No CI is configured.** `npm run check` currently runs only on my machine, so PR #46 carries my word rather than a green tick. Say *"add CI"* and I will add a GitHub Actions workflow that runs typecheck, tests, build, and audit on every push, so future PRs verify themselves.
